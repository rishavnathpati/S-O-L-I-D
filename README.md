# S-O-L-I-D
 # S.O.L.I.D Principles in Unity

SOLID is a set of f**ive principles for programming that we can apply it to just about any language especially any object-oriented language.**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should only have a single responsibility, ie, only changes to one part of the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class
2. **Open/Closed Principle:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** One should depend on abstractions, not concretions
